Since I need a day of pure lazyness, here's a dump of some open tabs:

Soundtrack for today: [Soundtracks for Everyday Adventures by Lullatone](http://lullatone.bandcamp.com/album/soundtracks-for-everyday-adventures)

## [Hackety Hack is back!](http://hackety-hack.com/)

Since \_why left us, Hackety Hack and shoes have been lovingly picked up by
steveklabnik and a few supporters. Now the site for Hackety Hack is finally
live again and already hosts a wide variety of fun little shoes apps.

## [Buy Domains and a logo idea in one](http://stylate.com/)

Originally posted at HN, this is still something I'd like to expand on... more on that in a future post.

## [The new Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/)

Mark Pilgrim also cut all his online ties, and left behind this gem of a book,
it's been my reference for everything HTML for the past year. A team of
volunteers also continues this project under the new domain name.

## [Live preview of markdown in js](http://www.showdown.im/)

This is quite a bit older, created by John Fraser in 2007, but I recently remembered it, and thought it would make a good addition to my blog.
Not sure I can ever quit writing markdown in vim, but preview is really something I need.

## [Be your own cloud storage provider](http://unhosted.org/)

Found yesterday, they make the case that you really could host your own files
in the cloud, which I happen to agree with.
There is no support for CouchDB yet, but jan\_\_\_\_ is working on it. I plan
to write another article about my thoughts on this project, as I'm not entirely
happy with their approach.

## [Stanford OpenClassroom](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/HomePage.php)

Stanford is providing a lot of courses, with videos of each topic, and even
"homework".
It seems like the videos were created by students, and I'd love to have
transcriptions, but overall a good first effort.

## [printf("goodbye, Dennis");](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/10/obituary-0)

Dennis Ritchie, a father of modern computing, died on October 8th, aged 70.

I owe him so much.
