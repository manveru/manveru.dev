A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, a language was forged, so powerful
and shrouded in mystery that, although it has permeated and influenced a whole
host of other languages, it remained obscure and generally unknown.

[Self](http://selflanguage.org/)

Unfortunately, this will stay this way for a little bit longer, since I cannot
seem to get it running on my machine, it keeps complaining:

It should be a smooth ride if you're on OSX, since that's what the developers
seem to use, but for now I've
[filed an issue](https://github.com/russellallen/self/issues/7)
and await further instructions.
