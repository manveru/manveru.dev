I'm playing with [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)
this weekend to port a little [Goban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_equipment#Board)
I wrote in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) last year to [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

One feature that's missing from LiveView currently is handling hovering, which I use to show where you can place your stones.
I found the [delightfully small source](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/blob/c2af8907867435060e6956b7900492a2f32ac055/assets/js/phoenix_live_view.js) for the Javascript side of LiveView.

It's really easy to read and understand (given you're a bit familiar with event
handling in JS), and it's also pretty straight-forward to add new events. The
only drawback is that I have to duplicate `closestPhxBinding`, `PHX_VIEW`, and
`PHX_VIEW_SELECTOR`, so hopefully they won't change too often.

```js
function closestPhxBinding(el, binding) {
  do {
    if(el.matches(`[${binding}]`)){ return el }
    el = el.parentElement || el.parentNode
  } while(el !== null && el.nodeType === 1 && !el.matches("[data-phx-view]"))
  return null
}

window.addEventListener("mouseover", e => {
  const outBinding = liveSocket.binding("mouseout")
  const overBinding = liveSocket.binding("mouseover")

  const target = closestPhxBinding(e.target, overBinding)
  const overPhxEvent = target && target.getAttribute(overBinding)
  const outPhxEvent = target && target.getAttribute(outBinding)

  if(!overPhxEvent || !outBinding){ return }

  function outHandler(e) {
    target.removeEventListener("mouseout", outHandler, false)
    e.preventDefault()
    liveSocket.owner(target, view => view.pushEvent("mouseout", target, outPhxEvent))
  }

  target.addEventListener("mouseout", outHandler, false)

  e.preventDefault()
  liveSocket.owner(target, view => view.pushEvent("mouseover", target, overPhxEvent))
}, false)

```

I'll just share this here because the project doesn't allow for new features yet
and it might come in handy for someone.
