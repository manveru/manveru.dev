# 2011-10-21: Self: the power of simplicity

A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, a language was forged, so powerful
and shrouded in mystery that, although it has permeated and influenced a whole
host of other languages, it remained obscure and generally unknown.

[Self](http://selflanguage.org/)

Unfortunately, this will stay this way for a little bit longer, since I cannot
seem to get it running on my machine, it keeps complaining:

It should be a smooth ride if you're on OSX, since that's what the developers
seem to use, but for now I've
[filed an issue](https://github.com/russellallen/self/issues/7)
and await further instructions.

# 2011-10-20: The ooc Language

Today I've decided to have a quick look at [ooc](http://ooc-lang.org/) and see
if I can accomplish the
[eBeats challenge](http://rubyists.github.com/2011/04/01/show-us-your-beats-earn-a-pizza.html)
in a day.

First of all, it seems like a nice little language, a pretty frontend for C,
with some of the ideals of [Nimrod](http://www.force7.de/nimrod/), but with a
lot more pragmatism.

I've joined
[#ooc-lang on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=ooc-lang&uio=d4)
to get some help along the way.

To start calculating eBeats, we need the current time in UTC, so let's look at what the documentation says:
[os/Time](http://docs.ooc-lang.org/sdk/os/Time.html).
Looking at this, I suddenly realize that I have little to no idea of what the
docs say, so I better read through the less terse material first. I notice
however that there doesn't seem to be anything related to UTC or GMT on this
page, that doesn't look good.

Working on getting anything recognizable from gmtime_r(3) doesn't turn out to be easy, but after 2 hours I've finally done it and see some actual times:

```` ooc
include time
import os/Time
import lang/Format

// struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result);
gmtime_r: extern func(TimeT*, TMStruct*) -> TMStruct*

main: func () {
  clock : TimeT
  time(clock&)

  time : TMStruct
  gmtime_r(clock&, time&)

  "%02i:%02i:%02i" cformat(time tm_hour, time tm_min, time tm_sec) println()
}
````

OK, so far everything seems fine, it's nothing to be proud of, but I won't stop here.

After some more fiddling, I come up with a `timeToBeats` function that takes
the time struct and spits out the integer value of eBeats, but I seemingly
cannot get anything more fine-grained. Let's see if you can find the bug.

```` ooc
timeToBeats: func (time: TMStruct) -> Float {
  beats := ((time tm_hour) * (1000.0 / 24.0)) +
           ((time tm_min)  * (1000.0 / (24.0 * 60.0))) +
           ((time tm_sec)  * (1000.0 / (24.0 * 60.0 * 60.0)))

  return beats
}
````

Done looking?

Well, anytime a developer uses Floats, everything has to be checked more than
twice.
In my case, after a little bit of further investigation and sprinkling
`cformat`/`println` all over the place, I found that `beats` wasn't a `Float`,
it was an `Int`, and ooc was so kind to just let me return an `Int` from a
function that has `Float` as explicit return type. What it did, and what I
cannot understand in modern language design, is that it implicitly converted
the `Int` into a `Float`, no warnings given, no questions asked.

Let's have a closer look at what's going on there, with a little experiment.

To keep it simple, I just divide a `Float` by an `Int`.

```` ooc
10.0 / 5 // 2.000000
````

The compiler says, when asked for really verbose output:

```` text
Resolving variable decl uniqueVar : <unknown type> = 10.0 / 5

For uniqueVar : Float = 10.0 / 5, resolving type Float, of type BaseType
````

So we really got a `Float` as result, wonderful!

And now we divide an `Int` by a `Float`

```` ooc
10 / 5.0 // 0.000000
````

The compiler says, when asked for really verbose output:

```` text
Resolving variable decl uniqueVar : <unknown type> = 10 / 5.0

For uniqueVar : SSizeT = 10 / 5.0, resolving type SSizeT, of type BaseType
````

Well, whatever `SSizeT` is, it doesn't talk or walk like a `Float`, and the
result is way worse than I had expected.

I'm running out of time to finish the post today, so I'll continue with the eBeats instead of diving further into the typing peculiarities of OCC.

After telling it that my return value really, really, is a `Float`, it complied and gave me the desired result. Here is the finished source:

```` ooc
include time
import os/Time

// struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result);
gmtime_r: extern func(TimeT*, TMStruct*) -> TMStruct*

main: func () {
  clock : TimeT
  time(clock&)

  time : TMStruct
  gmtime_r(clock&, time&)

  "@%f" cformat(timeToBeats(time)) println()
}

timeToBeats: func (time: TMStruct) -> Float {
  beats : Float
  beats = ((time tm_hour) * (1000.0 / 24.0)) +
          ((time tm_min)  * (1000.0 / (24.0 * 60.0))) +
          ((time tm_sec)  * (1000.0 / (24.0 * 60.0 * 60.0)))

  return beats
}
````

Future updates will go directly into
[the git repo](https://github.com/rubyists/ebeats-implementations/tree/master/ooc).
I of course welcome any contributions.

# 2011-10-19: Ruby for the Web

Ruby is the best language in the world for interacting with the web, and I'm
going to show you why.

This is a response to
[Python for the Web](http://gun.io/blog/python-for-the-web/)
from gun.io, just because I cannot stand people use the term "best"
without qualifying what aspect they refer to. And yes, "interacting with the web" is spongy enough to include all kinds of things.

In order to honor their "Most rights reserved." footer, I won't actually
rewrite their post, but give a succinct counter to each point.

## Interacting with Websites and APIs Using Ruby

First we'll handle two simple HTTP requests from the client side. For this we use the excellent
[REST Client](https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client)
gem, which can be installed via rubygems.

```` bash
gem install rest-client
````

```` ruby
require 'rest-client'

puts RestClient.get('http://gnu.io')
````

```` ruby
require 'rest-client'

puts RestClient.get('https://YOURUSERNAME:PASSWORD@api.github.com/user')
````

```` ruby
require 'rest-client'

url = 'https://example.com/form'
data = {title: 'RoboCop', description: 'The best movie ever.'}
RestClient.post(url, data)
````

As before, you can use the basic auth syntax if you require basic or digest authentication.

## Processing JSON in Ruby

Since JSON is in the stdlib, there is no need to install anything.

```` ruby
require 'json'
require 'rest-client'

c = RestClient.get('https://github.com/timeline.json')
j = JSON.parse(c)
j.each do |item|
  if repository = item['repository']
    puts repository['name']
  end
end
````

This also fixes a bug in the original code, as not every item in the timeline
has a repository key.

## Scraping the Web Using Ruby

Here I'll introduce you to [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/), the binding for
libxml2 and libxslt. The usage is heavily influenced by
[Hpricot](http://hpricot.com/) and improves upon it in terms of speed, memory
usage, accuracy, HTML correction, etc.

There is also a XML library in stdlib called
[REMXL](http://germane-software.com/software/rexml/), but there is not a single
time I've used it without regrets.

So first of all install nokogiri, this also requires installation of libxml2
and libxslt on Linux, I have no idea about other systems, but the authors seem
to have quite good documentation, so I'll leave the gritty details to them.

Here's how to do it on Arch Linux:

```` bash
sudo pacman -S libxml2 libxslt
gem install nokogiri
````

And here's how to use it for HTML in combination with RestClient, although I'd
personally use `open-uri` in this case for simplicity.

```` ruby
require 'nokogiri'
require 'rest-client'

tree = Nokogiri::HTML(RestClient.get('http://gun.io'))
tree.css('#frontsubtext').each do |element|
  puts element.text
end
````

Something that wasn't shown is how to use XPATH, since that's quite essential
for most HTML and XML juggling, here we go:

```` ruby
require 'nokogiri'
require 'rest-client'

tree = Nokogiri::HTML(RestClient.get('http://gun.io'))
tree.xpath('//a').each do |element|
  puts "#{element.text} : #{element[:href]}"
end
````

## Ruby Web Sites

And of course it's about time to plug my own project: [Ramaze](http://ramaze.net).

Let's make a little page equivalent of the gun.io example.

I won't go into much detail here, please check out
[the documentation](http://ramaze.net/documentation/index.html), as it will
answer any questions you have much better than I will be able to do here.

```` ruby
require 'ramaze'

class Home < Ramaze::Controller
  map '/'

  def index(*input)
    @output = input.join('/').upcase
    <<-'HTML'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta encoding="utf-8">
    <title>#{@output}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Your output is: #{@output}
  </body>
</html>
    HTML
  end
end

Ramaze.start
````

# 2011-10-10: Setting up Ramaze on Lighttpd2 with FCGI and Runit

A few days ago, when I was searching for a way to make a Ramaze application
available via proxy forwarding while also letting lighttpd handle X-Sendfile, I
was told that I'd have to use 1.5 or 2.0 to do that.

After a little digging it became clear that 1.5 would be a dead end, so i took
the plunge and looked into the new and shiny version 2.

So let's have a look at each of the parts. First we start with lighttpd, and
the new configuration.
Please note that this is only for my own site, your mileage may vary.

I'm using [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) for this, with [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/) as PID 1, as
[explained by bougyman](http://rubyists.com/2011/05/02/runit-for-ruby-and-everything-else.html).

The most important things are forwarding to fastcgi and setting the PATH_INFO
header, as the default lighttpd one is not suitable for Ramaze.

```` text
setup {
  module_load ( "mod_balance", "mod_expire", "mod_fastcgi", "mod_vhost", "mod_lua", "mod_accesslog" );
  lua.plugin "core.lua";

  listen "0.0.0.0:80";
  listen "[::]:80";

  log ["debug" => "", "*" => "/var/log/lighttpd2/error.log"];
  accesslog "/var/log/lighttpd2/access.log";
  accesslog.format "%h %V %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"";

  static.exclude_extensions ( ".php", ".pl", ".fcgi", "~", ".inc" );
}

include "/etc/lighttpd2/mimetypes.conf";

vhost.map [
  "manveru.name" => {
    docroot "/home/manveru/github/manveru/manveru.name/public/";
    index ("index.html");
  
    # deliver static files directly, forward everything else to fcgi
    if physical.is_file {
      header.add ("X-cleanurl", "hit");
    } else {
      header.add ("X-cleanurl", "miss");
      env.set "PATH_INFO" => "%{enc:req.path}";
      
      balance.rr (
        {fastcgi "unix:/var/run/lighttpd/sockets/manveru.name/0.sock";},
        {fastcgi "unix:/var/run/lighttpd/sockets/manveru.name/1.sock";},
        {fastcgi "unix:/var/run/lighttpd/sockets/manveru.name/2.sock";}
      );
    }
  
    # if req.path =~ "\.(png|css|gif)$" { expire "access 1 week"; }
  }
];

static;
````

Next up is the Ramaze configuration, in this case we make one from scratch,
just to make things a little bit more transparent and easier to control.

Eventually I want to make Ramaze easier to use with FCGI, but handling unix
sockets for you is probably fraught with too many issues to provide a
one-size-fits-all solution.

```` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'ramaze'

# FCGI doesn't like you writing to stdout
Ramaze::Log.loggers = [Ramaze::Logger::Informer.new(__DIR__("../ramaze.fcgi.log"))]

require_relative '../app'

# Initialize Ramaze, but don't start any server just yet.
Ramaze.options.trap = :SIGTERM # will need that for runit later.
Ramaze.start(root: __DIR__('../'), started: true)

socket = File.join(*ENV.values_at('RAMAZE_SOCKET', 'RAMAZE_SOCKET_NUMBER'))
socket << '.sock'
puts "Connecting to #{socket}"

# make sure the socket is closed.
FileUtils.rm_f(socket)

Thread.new do
  begin
    sleep 0.5 until File.socket?(socket)
    File.chmod(0660, socket)
    File.chown(Etc.getpwnam(Etc.getlogin).uid, Etc.getgrnam('www-data').gid, socket)
  rescue Exception => ex
    Ramaze::Log.error(ex)
    raise(ex)
  end
end

Rack::Handler.get(:fastcgi).run(Ramaze, File: socket)
````
