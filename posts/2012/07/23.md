# 2012-07-23: Keep testing your iron.io Ruby Workers

Just a quick example of how to use `$0` and `__FILE__` in Ruby to conditionally
use a file as a library or as an executable. It's a pattern at least as old as Ruby, but still quite useful.

First we start with our actual worker, it does heavy work trying to increase entropy in the universe, little does he know that rand is only pseudo-random.
At the end of the file, after the whole `EntropyGatherer` class has been executed, we put our `if $0 == __FILE__`, and place whatever code is needed to initialize and run the class. Of course you could just have single method instead of a class, or use a module with `module_function`, but this will have to do for our purposes.

I call this file `entropy_gatherer.rb`

```` ruby
class EntropyGatherer
  attr_reader :results

  def initialize
    @results = []
  end

  def run
    1.upto 100 do
      @results << rand
    end
  end
end

if $0 == __FILE__
  gatherer = EntropyGatherer.new
  gatherer.run
  puts gatherer.results
end
````

And here we have a file called `test_entropy_gatherer.rb`, which uses the familiar `Test::Unit` and can be executed with `testrb test_entropy_gaterer.rb`.

```` ruby
require "test/unit"
require_relative 'entropy_gatherer'

class TestEntropyGatherer < Test::Unit::TestCase
  # this runs before all tests
  def setup
    @gatherer = EntropyGatherer.new
    @gatherer.run
  end

  def test_result_size
    assert(@gatherer.results.size == 100, "wrong number of results")
  end

  def test_result_range
    @gatherer.results.each do |result|
      assert(result <= 1.0, "result greater than 1.0")
      assert(result >= 0.0, "result smaller than 0.0")
    end
  end
end

````

And here's how that all plays together.

```` txt
iota ~/tmp/iworker_rand % testrb -v test_entropy_gatherer.rb
