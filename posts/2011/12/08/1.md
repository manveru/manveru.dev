# 2011-12-08: Simplified Travis CI & RVM

[Last time](https://manveru.dev/blog/show/2011-10-22/en/Travis-CI-and-RVM) I
showed you one possibility of replacing bundler with rvm.

Today I want to improve on the hacky `.load_gemset` file, by simply putting it
into the `.travis.yml`.

It was irritating me to have such a roundabout way of loading rvm, and after
studying the way the configuration is being handled a bit more, this seemed so
obvious I can't believe I missed it before.

This is being used in [ffi-magic](https://github.com/manveru/ffi-magic)
already, and will shortly land in [Innate](https://github.com/Ramaze/innate) as
well.

Yeah, that's all, happy Continuous Integration.
