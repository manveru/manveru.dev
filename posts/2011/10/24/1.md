# 2011-10-24: Quick introduction to Memrise

For all of you who are learning languages, [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/)
is a website worth trying.

It uses the good old approach of spreading the learning of each word over an appropriate time, as you might already know from [the Anki spaced repetition algorithm](http://ankisrs.net/docs/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.html#_what_spaced_repetition_algorithm_does_anki_use).

The approach of Memrise works for more languages, and provides an excellent
interface, comparing words with flowers that need watering is one of the best
analogies they could've come up with.
