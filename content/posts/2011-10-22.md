title: Travis CI and RVM

After trying hooking up ooc and Tcl, waiting for the Self guys to respond, and
exploring [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org), I figured I'd share my short story
with you.

The documentation of Travis recommends using Bundler for managing dependencies
of your project.

Since I happen to like the way [gemsets](http://beginrescueend.com/gemsets/)
work, and Travis is using [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/) to manage the
different Ruby versions, I figured I could just call `rvm gemset import .gems`
and everything would be peachy.

For some reason, the rvm environment becomes broken once Travis starts your
tests, so you have to load it manually again, and then import your gemset.

I used this approach with [Innate](https://github.com/Ramaze/innate), and
here's the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/Ramaze/innate/blob/master/.travis.yml)

```` yaml
---
script: 'RUBYOPT=-rubygems rake bacon'

before_script:
  - "./.load_gemset"

rvm:
  - 1.8.7
  - 1.9.2
  - 1.9.3
  - rbx
  - rbx-2.0
  - ree
  - jruby

notifications:
  email:
    - mf@rubyists.com

branches:
  only:
    - master
````

And also the [.load_gemset](https://github.com/Ramaze/innate/blob/master/.load_gemset) executable referenced above:

```` bash
#!/bin/bash

[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*
[[ -s .gems ]] && rvm gemset import .gems
````

Please note that i do _not_ use `bash -e` as they recommend, it would terminate
the script before it comes to importing the gemset due to failure of loading
`.rvmrc`, as RVM asks the user and we have no tty access. That's no big issue,
as we will notice what's going wrong when our specs don't pass anymore anyway.

That's all, happy Continuous Integration.
